# Calibration of the Virtual Core to determine cell abundances
SeaFlow is a novel flow cytometer developed for continuous real-time observations of natural assemblages of small phytoplankton cells, including <i>Prochlorococcus</i>. Unlike other flow cytometers, SeaFlow does not use sheath fluid. Instead, a virtual core is used to determine the position of a particle in the stream of seawater. To determine cell abundances of different populations, the volume of the Virtual Core is first calculated by multiplying the volume of the detectable region (cross-sectional area within the stream where particles are detected by the laser) by the ratio of particles in the virtual core to total detectable particles. We evaluated the performance of the instrument on multiples cruises. Samples were collected for analysis by a BD Influx cell sorter and compared with samples analyzed with SeaFlow. Results are shown below.
